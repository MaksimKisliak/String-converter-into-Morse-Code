<p>README</p>
<p>This repository contains a Python script called <code>convert_to_morse_code.py</code> which converts a string to Morse code.</p>How to Use
<ol>
 <li>Clone the repository to your local machine.</li>
 <li>Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned.</li>
 <li>Run the following command to execute the script:</li>
</ol>
<pre>Copy code<code>python convert_to_morse_code.py
</code></pre>
<ol>
 <li>When prompted, enter the string you want to convert to Morse code.</li>
 <li>The script will output the Morse code representation of the input string.</li>
</ol>Dependencies
<p>This script requires Python 3.x to run.</p>How it Works
<p>The script uses a dictionary called <code>MORSE_CODE_DICT</code> to map each character to its corresponding Morse code representation. It then loops through each character in the input string and looks up its Morse code representation in the dictionary. The resulting Morse code strings are concatenated together with spaces to form the final output.</p>License

<p>This script was created as part of a coding exercise. The <code>MORSE_CODE_DICT</code> dictionary was obtained from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code#Letters,_numbers,_punctuation,_prosigns_for_Morse_code_and_non-Latin_variants" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
